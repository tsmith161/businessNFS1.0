        <h2>Company Founding</h2><br>
        <p style = "color:#004e7a;">
            Founded by a seasoned global risk and governance leader, NFS Insights Advisory was established to bring board-level rigor and real-world execution to organizations facing growing complexity, risk, and regulatory pressure. 
            The firm was founded by Nancy Freda-Smith, a CPA and Certified Fraud Examiner with more than two decades of experience leading internal audit, enterprise risk management, asset protection, and governance functions for NYSE-listed and multinational companies. 
            Drawing on a career spanning public company boards, Fortune 500 leadership roles, and advisory work at Deloitte, the firm was created to close the gap between theoretical risk frameworks and practical, value-driven solutions.
        </p><br>
        <p style="color:#004e7a;">
            NFS Insights Advisory was built in response to a recurring challenge observed across industries: organizations often identify risks but lack the structure, discipline, or insight to act on them decisively. 
            The firm was founded to help leaders move from awareness to action—strengthening controls, reducing fraud and operational leakage, and improving resilience in an increasingly volatile business environment.
